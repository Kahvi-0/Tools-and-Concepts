# WebEnum

This tool for enumerating websites using the following techniques:

- Directory brute forcing 

- sorting the results by response code

- Screenshoting every page

- Running vulnerability scans against the site
  
 **To add CMS and tech discovery later to tie into tech specific vuln scanners such as wpscan**
 
 All information is added to an overview HTML page that displays all discovered information.
