Sniff options: 
 
  - Unified: sniffs all packets on cable
  - Bridged: uses two interfaces and forwards the traffic from one to the other
  
  
  View captured traffic: View -> Connections
  
  
  Scan for hosts: Hosts -> scan for hosts
  
     Add targets: 
     
          Select one and "Add to target 1" and 2 for the other.
          
   Can select as many hosts as you want, but things may get bottlenecked.
   Note: if no targets are selected, Ettercap will auto set ANY (all hosts) in the target list. 
   
   
   
   
   Attacks: 
   
   ARP poison: Normally you want to choose just "Sniff remote connections"
