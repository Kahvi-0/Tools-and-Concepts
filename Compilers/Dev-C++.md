Compiling tools: under MinGW64/bin  (add to environment path to make easier)

Note: MinGW64 is an improved version of MinGW (Minimalist GNU compiler for Windows), which provides programming tools for developing native MS-Windows apps. 


Compile .c or .cpp files: 

use gcc.exe 

    gcc -m32 <file.c> -o <file.exe>

      -m32  32bit environment
