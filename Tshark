## TSHARK is a command line based companion tool to wireshark. Where wireshark is great for microscopic analysis, Tshark is great for automation.

Tshark may be set up to only let root use pcap. For best practise, do not run this as root. to change:
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
    -select yes
  - sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
   newgrp wireshark

Interfaces: 
  Default only accept packets destined for it or broadcast or chose multicast.
  
  Promiscuous, tell interface to accept all packets. 
    sudo ifconfig $interface promisc
  
  Monitor mode: Basically promiscous mode for wireless (802.11)
